# Sorting-for-DSA
This repository contains programs implementing various sorting algorithms for DSA.

## Files in the Folder

### 1. `BubbleSort.cpp`
Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm, which repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

### 2. `SelectionSort.cpp`
Implements the Selection Sort algorithm, which repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning.

### 3. `InsertionSort.cpp`
Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm, which builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.

### 4. `MergeSort.cpp`
Implements the Merge Sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer technique that recursively divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.

### 5. `QuickSort.cpp`
Implements the Quick Sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer technique that selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

### 6. `RecursiveBubbleSort.cpp`
Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm using recursion, where adjacent elements are repeatedly swapped if they are in the wrong order.

### 7. `RecursiveSelectionSort.cpp`
Implements the Selection Sort algorithm using recursion, where the smallest element is repeatedly selected and placed at the beginning of the array.

### 8. `RecursiveInsertionSort.cpp`
Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm using recursion, where elements are inserted into their correct position one at a time.
